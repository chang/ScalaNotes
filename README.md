### Scala Notes

Scala, Spark. Fun stuff. I used the resources listed below:

[Advanced Analytics with Spark, 2nd Edition](http://github.com/sryza/aas) - a great cookbook for Spark 2.0+

[Functional Programming Principles in Scala](http://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1) - on Coursera with Martin Odersky himself

[Twitter's Scala School](http://twitter.github.io/scala_school/) - a quick and dirty intro to Scala syntax, more suited towards programmers with some Java experience

[underscore.io](http://underscore.io/books/) - a collection of free, high quality ebooks
